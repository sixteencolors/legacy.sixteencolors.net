<ul>

<p>

The Sixteen Colors ANSI and ASCII Artwork Archive is a carefully maintained collection of artwork created and released by groups 
birthed in the underground artscene of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" target="_blank">Bulletin Board Systems</a> (BBSes). This vibriant, unique and highighly talented and technical art scene gave rise to a 
digital culture that will forever be apart of the history of the information age. The same skill, culture and highly competive 
group of individuals still work with their respective groups to make regular releases of some of the finest textmode artwork 
you'll ever see. Welcome to Sixteen Colors.

<p>
For those of you unfamiliar with this highly expressive and vibrant medium, ANSI and ASCII artwork is a computer artwork medium that was widely used at one time on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" target="_blank">BBSes</a>. It is similar to ASCII art, but constructed from a larger set of 256 letters, numbers, and symbols â€” all codes found in IBM code page 437, often referred to as extended ASCII and used in MS-DOS and UNIX environments. ANSI art also contains special ANSI escape sequences that color text with the 16 foreground and 8 background colors offered by ANSI.SYS, an MS-DOS device driver loosely based upon the ANSI X3.64 standard for text terminals.
